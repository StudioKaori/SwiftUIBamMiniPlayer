### Issue: Non SwiftUI View class cannot access to Environmental object

Message handler class is dealing with communication between JS on Webview and native app. But itâ€™s non SwiftUI View class and cannot access to Environmental object

#### -> Change Message Handler to a singleton object

Message Handler class will be the owner of the player statuses (isPlayerViewVisible, isPlayerMinimised) instead of the Environmental object.

To hold consistent player statuses, I created singleton instance of Message Handler (name: MessageHandler.shared)

### Issue: To make mini player visible over the other view

The mini player must be over any visible views such as product page, home page etc

#### -> Set playerView over the navigation link

So that the playerView is always top of any views (pages)

For that, declared the following observable variables in Environmental project

```
@Published var isPlayerViewVisible: Bool = false
@Published var isPlayerMinimised: Bool = false
```
